=== MySQL Recovery Options ===
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] MySQL is still not running. Here are some additional steps to try:
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 
1. Check the MySQL error log at C:\xampp\mysql\data\mysql_error.log
[2025-04-15 17:59:30]    Look for specific error messages that might indicate the problem.
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 
3. Try fixing corrupted tables:
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] To fix corrupted MySQL tables, try the following:
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 1. Try using the MySQL repair utility:
[2025-04-15 17:59:30]    - For MyISAM tables: mysqlcheck -r --all-databases -u root -p
[2025-04-15 17:59:30]    - For InnoDB tables: Start MySQL with the --innodb-force-recovery=1 option
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 2. If that doesn't work, restore from a backup
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 3. If no backup is available, try recreating the corrupted tables
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 
4. If you can't access MySQL at all, you might need to reset the password:
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] MySQL Password Reset Instructions:
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 1. Stop the MySQL service
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 3. Navigate to MySQL bin directory (e.g., C:\xampp\mysql\bin)
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 4. Run: mysqld --defaults-file="C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini" --init-file=C:\reset-pw.txt --console
[2025-04-15 17:59:30]    Where reset-pw.txt contains: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 5. Once MySQL starts, press Ctrl+C to stop it
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 6. Restart MySQL service normally
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 7. Try connecting with the new password
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 
5. As a last resort, you can reinstall MySQL or restore from a backup
[2025-04-15 17:59:30]    Make sure to back up your data directory first!
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] 
Diagnostic process completed. Check the log for details and recommended actions.
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] If the problem persists, consider checking the MySQL error log and Windows Event Viewer
[2025-04-15 17:59:30] for more detailed information about what's causing the shutdown.
